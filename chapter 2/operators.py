#Arthematic operators
# = is an assignment operator  
a = 5
b = 7
c = a + b

b=6
# b+=5 # This means increment b by 5 and then assign it to b
b-=5 # Decrement the value of b by 5 and give it to b
print(b)

#comparision operator

a = 5<4

b = 5!=7 # 5 is not equal to 7 
print(b) 

#logical opeators 
e =  True or False # in or operator one of the side shouold be true 
f =  True and False # in and operator both of the sides should be true 

# logical operators truth table for or
